'''
Firstly X and Obj two variables are defined. Both of them go under a for loop.
x goes under turn by turn iteration, and values of inner dictionaries with refrence 
to the outer ones are stored in obj.Now Another for loop is implied on the obj
variable and the values of inner dictionaries go under turn by turn iterations.
This is how all the outer and inner items of dictionaries are printed in a proper
sequence.
